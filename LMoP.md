# Session 1 - A Fist Full of Gold Coins

The party gathered in Neverwinter's bar,
To meet with Gundren Rockseeker, they'd come from afar,
The mission at hand, they agreed to fulfill,
Deliver supplies and earn their goodwill.

Wagon and supplies were included in the agreement,
As were two precious oxen, requiring the best of treatment
Ten golden gears for each, they'd gain,
And set out on the Tribal Trail in the rain.

But trouble brewed when Raknar was named
An albatross, a cursed one, they claimed.
The locals and party clashed in fight,
With Bry's hammer and Nameroc's might.

Ryker soothed with his hands during the fray,
But faces were still broken that fateful day.
Upon awakening, Gudren and Sildar disappeared in the night,
Two dead horses on the pathway offered an eerie sight.

But goblins waylaid them with arrows and might,
Raknar breathed frost, a fearsome sight,
But he took a hit, an arrow in his side,
Nearly brought him down, wounded and tired.

Zaila's laughter broke a goblin's will,
And charmed another, they couldn't kill,
With Shillelagh and battle hammer in hand,
They fought the goblins and took a stand.

Through danger and strife, the party pushed on,
Towards Phandalin, their journey long,
With each step, their story unfolds,
Of battles fought, and fortunes told.

# Session 2 - A Flood of Goblins

In the cave, a flood of goblins swarmed,
The party braved, all fully warned.
Zaila's vision pierced the dark,
Bard of elves, their guiding spark.

Bry, the dwarf, resolute and strong,
Together they entered, the others following along.
A cliff stood tall, where Sildar remained,
Imperiled, captured, his fate constrained.

Ryker, the paladin, wet and worn,
With Misty Step cast, a hero was born.
Raknar, Dragonborn, with feather's fall,
Saved Sildar from a perilous close call.

Nameroc transformed, a spider's might,
Climbing the cliff, ready to fight.
The goblins met their fateful end,
Their lives, in battle, did fully descend.

Raknar hurled one with might and brawn,
Bry’s war hammer struck, its soul withdrawn.
In the heat of combat, Zaila's grip,
Lost a puzzle box, a regretful slip.

Rune-covered, it holds secrets untold,
Awaiting its opening, a tale yet to unfold.
The party reaped rewards as they had earned,
Full pay, delivered as they had yearned.

Sildar's gratitude, a reward bestowed,
Their pockets filled, their fortune flowed.
Trundle and Bear, the oxen protected,
Because of Molly’s love, their fate was respected.

A spaghetti dinner, a feast embraced,
Collecting payment, they found their place.
Stone Hill Inn, where they lay their heads,
Bart, the owner, ensured their beds.

The elven bard, their watchful guide,
As they slumbered deep, dreams untied.
Visions of spending their funds just collected,
In Phandalin, though a town so neglected.

But Gundren's whereabouts, a mystery still,
His fate unknown, his presence nil.
In their dreams, they seek his trace,
Their journey's purpose, a lingering chase.

So rest they now, with purpose anew,
On the road ahead, another goal to pursue.

# Session 3 - The Lost Session

Little is know of this session, but the party did ask Zaila about the mysterious puzzle box, as did a new mysterious stranger with an almost german accent.

# Session 4 - Into the Nothic's Tunnel

In Phandalin they ventured, oh, what a sight,
With Garaele's health restored, all feeling right.
A mute girl they found, with eyes so unique,
Oh, the wonders they'd see, oh, the tales they'd speak!

The next morn arrived, with a deadline so tight,
A puzzlebox trade for dear Gundren's plight.
Molly led the way, with her halfling stride,
Into the forest, where secrets did hide.

Through the tunnel they ventured, dark and deep,
Encountering Ixal, a creature to keep.
With thoughts it would read, and flesh it would rot,
An eye so cyclopean, otherworldly and hot.

Ixal had glimpsed the Forge of Spells, you see,
But now craved for flesh, oh, what misery!
The party fought bravely, with might they did wield,
Defeating bugbears, their fate was soon sealed.

But alas, the noise awoke others around,
Their presence now known, a challenge profound.
Oh, the adventures they'd face, as dangers accrue,
Will Gundren come home
And their faith be renewed.

# Session 5 - Along Came a Spider

In a basement full of trouble, decay in the air,
The heroes embarked on tale we must share.
The Red Boys pushed and banged, breaking down the door,
But our heroes welcomed them, to settle the score.

Nameroc, clever and sly, locked the door with thorny vine,
Buying time for the feast, oh, how divine!
For Ixal the Nothic, with a hunger untamed,
Required meaty bits, or so he proclaimed.

From the dungeon dark, prisoners did they find,
But Clint the sheriff lay lifeless, left behind.
Ryker, filled with vengeance, struck a mighty blow,
And justice was served, as guilt did go.

And then, from the darkness, a Talon appeared,
With wings spread wide, burnished steel, oh they cheered!
The longsword was claimed, unexpected and grand,
A powerful treasure, held tightly in hand.

Back in town, the party saw a curious sight,
The wizard Glasstaff captured, not one to fight.
But time was short, a long rest they did seek,
When alchemist fire was sparked, the chances seemed bleak.

Glasstaff escaped, leaving Harbin in his wake,
With a guilty demeanor, the party did take.
To the Crossroads Saloon, they carried him near,
Tying him to trees before their daring affair.

And then, amidst the chaos, they met the Black Spider,
A female drow elf, her presence much wider.
With an umbrella in hand and a captive named Gundren,
Heroes stood strong, their courage unshaken.

And then in the darkness the Spider did show,
Umbrella in hand and a captive beaten by many a blow.
But the heroes stood strong, the confidence unshaken,
While spider discoursed on the deal undertaken.

On one side, the heroes, on the other, Black Spider,
Separated by a table, tension growing wider.
A command was given, compelling to be made,
A key tossed in the air and freedom conveyed.

But Bry, in her haste, stumbled through the floor,
Caught before Gundren, who attacked with a roar.
Moonlight and daggers filled the swirling night,
As Black Spider and Gundren vanished from sight.

"Hurry, Montieth! We've got what we need!
These peasants are not worth our time," she decreed.

# Session 6 - Reidoth's Faerie Circle

In a world of adventure, with heroes so bold,
They chased The Black Spider, through the storm and the cold.
Through a forest they ventured, their spirits were high,
Guided by tracks, like Swiss cheese in the sky.

Into a glade, so inviting and sweet,
A place for a rest, where their tired wet feet.
Zaila's watch ended, with dancing and glee,
As chaos erupted, “I will join,” said she.

Bells chimed on ankles, tiny voices in song,
The fairies had come, a caucaphonous throng.
Some played instruments, so nimble and bright,
A fiddle played fastest, a brownie's delight.

Golden fairy wine flowed, splashing with grace,
As they danced and twirled, in this magical space.
Bry and Zaila joined, dancing through the night,
While the party met Reidoth, with eyes shining bright.

A druid of questions, his motives unknown,
He urged them to fight dragons, all on their own.
With gifts from the fairies, a night full of cheer,
They ventured to Venomfang's lair, without fear.

Emerald scales and a fierce wicked glare,
Venomfang waited, with a menacing air.
His eyes gleamed with malice, piercing the night,
Striking fear in hearts, with his venomous bite.

Coiled like a serpent, his power untold,
Waiting to unleash his breath, so bold.
The party was coughing, overmatched, overwhelmed,
They fled from the dragon dashing leg they impelled.

Back to the circle, they found solace and rest,
Then journeyed to lands near Cragmore Keep, their quest.
At Cragmore, oh Cragmore what a a wondrous sight!
Nameroc transformed to an owl and took flight.

Through the seven towers, decayed and forlorn,
He uncovered their secrets, and a plan was then born.
20 goblins plus King Grol with a dream in his heart
Maybe an ambush would be a good start.

# Session 7 - Dwarf-napping of Bryllin Stoneheart

In the lands around Cragmore, the heroes did scout,
With a plan to lure goblins, there was no doubt.
Ryker, so handsome, became the bait,
To draw them out, and seal their fate.

The goblins fell for the trap, oh what a sight,
A dozen troops marched into the clearing, with might.
Zaila and Raknar, a powerful pair,
Unleashed thunderous waves and icy breath in the air.

Our heroes captured a goblin, trying to flee,
And Nameroc's owl swooped down on another with glee.
They interrogated the prisoner, seeking the truth,
Learning that King Grol with but half of his troop.

And just as the heroes turned, filled with surprise,
They heard the words, "Ms. Stoneheart, it's no disguise."
Ruddy-skinned hobgoblins, charging with might,
A horrific shield, with hands nailed tight.

They all carried a fire flails burning with dread,
Using infernal magic, off with Bry they led.
And into the woods, they whisked her away,
Leaving the heroes to battle, much in dismay.

One by one, the hobgoblins fell to their fate,
Bursting into flames, turning to ash, so great.
Who sent these beings, with allegiances foul?
What other creatures may soon come a prowl?

# Session 8 - The Fall of King Grol

In Cragmore Keep, a plan they did make,
To distract goblins with a fiery quake.
Raknar, so clever, set the kitchen ablaze,
While Nameroc, an owl, joined in on the craze.

The party charged the front door, with the bulk of their might,
And found a Grick in the rafters, nearly out of sight.
Arrows bounced off, no match for its skin,
Yet the heroes fought on, with a battle weary grin.

The Grick and the Owl, feathers did fly,
A furious battle, up in the sky.
Victorious, the owl, with a triumphant cry,
The Grick defeated, to everyone's eye.

Zaila's blades whirled, blocking their path,
While Ryker stood tall, no fear and no wrath.
Meanwhile, Raknar ventured out on his own,
To find King Grol, sat high his throne.

With a dasterdly drow elf, the king was seen,
Raknar led them to where the party had been.
An ambush sprung, with fire and might,
The whole party battled, in the dark of the night.

As the old king fell, his dreams did depart,
Of a great goblin kingdom, strong and smart.
Gundren was rescued, with rewards to share,
For a 10th of Wave Echo, heroes would dare.

# Session 9 - Echos of Battles Never Won

On the way to the Caverns, an invite they did find,
To a wedding celebration, a joyous bind.
Gifts and a potluck dish, oh what a delight,
With food on the plate, it must be just right.

But soon they stumbled upon a gathering so sad,
Not a wedding, but a funeral they had.
Bink the kobold, so kind and polite,
Invited them to join, no gifts were in sight.

A plate with food, that's all they should bring,
To honor the departed, to sweetly sing.
Yet our brave heroes decided to decline,
With a mission ahead, they couldn't align.

To the old Dwarven bridge, Bink led the way,
The kobolds had destroyed, only chains did sway.
Inside the caverns, magic shimmered bright,
With twists and turns, a mysterious flight.

Emerging at last, in the mine's entry hall,
Attacked by Stirges, they had to stand tall.
Ryker's divine light, with a radiant flare,
Crackled and fried them, with a triumphant glare.

Delving deeper, they reached into the Great Hall,
Where a mighty battle brought shadows over all.
Ogres, orcs, dwarves, and human remains,
Scattered from a battle that marked their campaigns.

Beady-eyed of ghouls with hunger in their hearts,
Rushed towards the party, like menacing darts.
But with hammer and Talon, and Thunderous might,
They battled the ghouls, in the darkest of night.

Those once combatants, gnawing bones for years,
Released by death, their spirits shed tears.
In the chaos of the caverns, they fought on with zeal,
Our brave heroes showed valor, their true hearts revealed.

# Session 10  - A Skull of Flames
Our heroes charged forth, brave and true,
Following the ore carts, as dwarves often do.
A smelter they found and zombies all around,
In battle, they fought, their hearts unbound.

A smell of sulphur, and metal so bright,
The forge began to glow, a eerie green light.
From the smokestack, a creature did arise,
Flameskull it was, with menacing eyes.

Mesmerizing and horrifying, it did appear,
Eye sockets like portals, filling all with fear.
A tortured face, of a wizard once known,
Now in flames, it sadly did moan.

The flameskull released a fireball so wild,
Bry fell, burned and unconscious, and the creature just smiled!
Raknar's force ballista, a clever creation,
Distracted the flameskull, a perfect temptation.

And as fire bolts struck with a dazzling effect,
Ryker's flying step. The flameskull did wreck.
In two parts, the skull was cleverly cleft,
A heroic act, leaving foes bereft.

In the starry chamber, a wraith they did find,
Nameroc's eagle form, chasing behind.
Into Bry's divine blade, the wraith did expire,
A courageous act, sending its soul to retire.

Then came the black spider, with haughtiness and glee,
But with eagle beaks and talons sharp, they were set free.
Spiders and Doppelgängers, foes they did thwart,
With valor and wit, the heroes did depart.

Leaving with a puzzle box, a mystery to unlock,
A note from Wave Echo Caves, a riddle to take stock.
In this cavernous world, where heroes rise,
They faced challenges and won, to everyone's surprise.

# Session 11 - The Spider's Fall

Upon a morn so darkly draped in mystery's shroud,
The Black Spider, her nefarious presence vowed,
Had vanished, fled from sight, without trace or sound,
No marks of struggle, no battle scars were found.

The revelers stirred from slumber's heavy embrace,
To a scene bereft of turmoil's trace,
Exploration beckoned in shadows deep,
To unearth secrets hidden where old shadows creep.

A temple, long forgotten, stood in solemn grace,
Dedicated to Dumathoin, in that gloomy space,
Ancient stones whispered secrets untold,
Eyes of ancient deity, watching as stories did unfold.

Within the Starry Chamber's enigmatic embrace,
Raknar, with courage, did a seal displace,
Revealing Forge of Spells, a realm arcane,
Yet within it dwelled a visage, grotesque and insane.

Eyestalks uncountable, a gaze unnerving,
But not a foe's stance, no malice deserving,
Instead, a riddle posed, enigma profound,
Two eyes sundered, history unbound.

"What has two eyes, torn by Phandelver's strife?"
The question posed, a puzzle of life,
"Ixal and Laxi," came the swift reply,
Thus earned they a boon, 'neath the vaulted sky.

Each item of value, enchanted in flames' dance,
Placed into the fire's mystical trance,
Emerging with magic, intensified and pure,
Rare artifacts blessed, power to endure.

In dark shadows, this tale would entwine,
A saga of magic, riddles, and new design,
Black Spider's death, a closing of this book,
But now another quests will they soon brook

# The Lay of Phandelver
These are the last words of Master Grimrock, a forgotten dwarven combatant in Wave Echo Caverns. Read carefully it reveals the identity of the wizard.

  
In the land of Phandelver the riches did flow
A peace was defined for our children to grow
Dwarves, gnomes, and humans united they stood,
Their ores and their artifact made magical good.

Yet as magics bounty grew, a rift did they form,
And Dumathoin divined, an impending storm.
From north and east, envy's seed took hold,
In hearts of orcs and wizards, cruel and bold.

Orcs and ogres, aided by dark sorcery's might,
Descended upon Wave Echo, a curse in the night.
They laid waste to all, with fury unrestrained,
And the Forge of Spells declined, its power now drained.

As battles raged and hope seemed to dim,
A brave hero emerged, determined to win.
Yet, within the Great Hall, wisdom took its stand,
Mighty Alalix, the wizard, took command.

He sealed the mines, the precious veins of ore,
By sundering himself, he sealed the door.
The Forge of Spells, hidden, safe from harm,
Till two parts combined, it lay dormant and calm.

These two parts, both similar, and of one speaking mind,
Yet different to the eye, great secrets did they bind.
Now the Lay of Phandelver, written by my hand,
A tale of sacrifice as we make our final stand.

They come... Hardhand Grimrock
